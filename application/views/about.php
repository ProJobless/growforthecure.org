			<p>Our friend's battle with lung cancer brought to our attention the lack of funding available for lung cancer research. Alarmed by this inadequacy, we started Grow for the Cure to provide an interactive place to not only raise research money, but ignite discussion on this killer disease. Our goal is to improve patientsâ€™ lives through more research and better treatment options.</p>

			<p>Lung cancer is ugly and deafeningly serious, but that does not mean raising money for it needs to be. Imagine if men could raise money simply by not shaving. It takes an average of 15 days to grow a beard. During that time, approximately 6,500 people have died of lung cancer and over 9,000 new diagnoses were made. Together, we will make an impact on those numbers! Historically, funding for lung cancer research has lagged that of its cancer peers due to the stigma of smoking. You do not have to smoke to get lung cancer; our friend never did.</p>

			<p>Raising money is only half the battle--directing it to the right resources is paramount. With this in mind, we realized the need to partner with a larger organization that could provide access to innovative research projects thereby maximizing the impact of your donation. There is no better organization that fits the bill than the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation (BJALCF). Their reach is international and their scope focused.</p>

			<p>Our goals are ambitious and clear. The Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation will deploy all net proceeds on the front lines of lung cancer research. We pledge to be transparent and steadfast with your donations and trust. Please let us know how we can be of service to you and a sincere thank you for visiting our site.</p>
