		<ul class="growfacts">
			<li>There are about 30,000 beard hairs on the face of the average man—the greatest concentration on the chin and upper lip</li>
			<li>Hair grows an average of half a millimeter a day</li>
			<li>Hair grows faster during the day than at night</li>
			<li>The ideal shave angle (razor blade meeting the face) is 28-32 degrees</li>
			<li>Hair on the neck grows parallel to the skin</li>
			<li>42% of men report that they prefer to be clean shaven, 34% say they have a moustache, 19% have sideburns, 17% have a goatee, 6% have a full beard, and 3% have a soul patch </li>
			<li>The average shave lasts 3 ½ minutes</li>
			<li>The average man spends 10-15 hours a year shaving</li>
			<li>The average man will have spent 900 hours shaving (the equivalent of 37 1/2 days) between ages 15 and 75</li>
			<li>The majority of men, 84%, shave at the sink. Another 15% of men shave in the shower</li>
			<li>The average man begins to shave regularly when he begins to work regularly</li>
			<li>Men between the ages of 18 and 24 shave an average of four times a week</li>
			<li>Men over the age of 35 shave an average of six times a week</li>
			<li>Length of beard an average man would grow if he never shaved: 27.5 feet</li>
			<li>Shamsher Singh of Punjab, India, had his beard officially measured in 1997 at an impressive 6 ft. from the end of chin to the tip</li>
			<li>The beard develops during puberty. Beard growth is linked to stimulation of hair follicles in the area by dihydrotestosterone, which continues to affect beard growth after puberty. Hair follicles from different areas vary in what hormones they are stimulated or inhibited by; dihydrotestosterone also promotes balding. Dihydrotestosterone is produced from testosterone, the levels of which vary with season; thus beards grow faster in summer</li>
			<li>Charles Darwin first noted a possible evolutionary explanation of beards in his work, The Descent of Man, which hypothesized that the process of sexual selection may have led to beards. Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards, concluding that there is evidence that a preponderance of females in the past found mates with beards more attractive than mates without beards</li>

		<p class="question">Will I be able to grow a beard or mustache?</p>
		<p class="answer">The answer to this question appears to depend mainly on your genetic makeup. There is considerable variance in both the developmental pace and the quantity of facial hair that different men are able to grow. These varying developmental patterns seem to be largely related to inherited traits-- though keep in mind that a guy may not be able to accurately predict his own facial hair growth based on that of his male relatives.</p>
		<p class="question">What can I do to make my beard grow thicker?</p>
		<p class="answer">Not much, 90% of how your beard looks is determined by genetics and age. However, good alimentation and grooming habits will help maximize what you have and keep the hair in optimal shape.</p>
		<p class="question">Will shaving make my beard grow in thicker or faster?</p>
		<p class="answer">No, shaving will not make your facial hair grow in any thicker or faster. There are a couple of reasons why your hair might feel like it is growing in thicker after shaving. First, hair tends to be thicker and darker near the root and becomes thinner near the end of the hair as it grows out. When you shave a hair, you are cutting it close to the thicker root end, creating a much shorter hair with a sharper edge close to the skin's surface. This leaves a stiffer "stubble" effect when you rub your face in the day or two following your shave. Once the hair grows out, it will begin to feel softer again.</p>
		<p class="question">How long does it take to reach natural maximum beard length?</p>
		<p class="answer">Here again, it will depend on genetics. Every man has a maximum length his beard hairs can reach – that length will evolve with age and that length is different on all parts of the face. For example, hair in the middle of the upper lip is somewhat short, while hair on the chin can grow feet.</p>
		<p class="question">How do you deal with comments from friends, family or coworkers?</p>
		<p class="answer">First, don’t panic and do not run to the razor at the first comment. It is normal for them to comment; after all, they are seeing you going through a big change and they will notice. Let this be an opportunity to tell them about Grow for the Cure and about your role in fighting lung cancer!</p>
		<p class="question">What can I do to make my whiskers softer?</p>
		<p class="answer">Hair is covered with one or more protective outer layers called the cuticle. The more cuticle layers there are, the coarser the hair feels. Conditioner is designed to soften the cuticle layers, so try using it on your beard. As a general rule, shorter whiskers often feel stiffer than longer whiskers -- just like an inch-long piece of wire feels stiffer than a foot-long piece of the same wire. Trimming is another factor. Trimming leaves whiskers with blunt, sharp ends. Those ends start to round off after a few days.<br></p>

		<p class="question">Trimming facial hair.</p>
		<p class="answer">When the grow period is over, you can begin to define your neckline, cheek line, and mustache or goatee lines with a razor or an electric beard trimmer on its lowest setting. A single blade razor will offer better control than a multi-blade, as will a straight razor if you know how to use one. Do not over-trim at this stage!</p>
		<p class="answer">Once you have defined the lines of your winning style, decide the length you would like and trim it accordingly. If you are aiming for a longer or fuller beard style, continue to let it grow while maintaining your previously-constructed outlines.</p>
		<p class="answer">Once you've grown and styled your beard or mustache the way you like it, you will then have to maintain it with periodic trimming. Most beards and mustaches will need trimming every few days, or every week at the least.
		<p class="answer">If you opt for the scissors and comb method of trimming, choose a pair of barber's scissors if possible-- they are sharp and designed to cut hair. If you go the electric trimmer route, be sure to purchase one that is specifically for beard and mustache trimming. Electric clippers that are used for haircuts tend to be too wide for effective use on the face. Look for a trimmer with numerous length-guide attachments, so you'll have several options.</p>
		<p class="answer">Trimming of your beard or mustache should be done while the hair is dry. This is because wet hair will tend to appear longer, and as such you risk trimming too much when your hair is wet. For this reason, you should trim your beard and mustache first and maintain your beard's outlines afterward, especially if you are using a wet razor to shave your neck or cheeks.</p>
		<p class="question">Keeping facial hair clean.</p>
		<p class="answer">Just like the hair on your head, your facial hair needs to be washed regularly. A mild shampoo is better to use on facial hair than bar soap, which will tend to dry your skin. If your beard feels coarse and dry after washing, try applying a conditioner after shampooing-- be sure to rinse well. Comb your beard and mustache to remove tangles, and gently pat your beard dry with a towel when finished. If you wear a very long or thick beard, you may want to finish grooming with a brush.</p>
